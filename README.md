## About Me

I am a computer science student who studying in Universiti Teknologi Malaysia.  
I use GitHub to document my learning journey, coursework, and practice projects as I build a strong foundation in programming and problem-solving.
I believe in **consistent learning, clear understanding, and gradual improvement** rather than rushing into advanced topics without fundamentals.
